# Jello Slap Tug-Of-War (with Nyx Daniels, Jeffrey Gassenheimer, and Ike McNutt)

We were tasked with creating a game using two of the following items:

* water bottle caps
* CDs
* yarn
* gel or jello
* stress bricks
* bubble sheet strips
* soda cans
* binder clips

Here are some of the games we brainstormed but did not decide on:

Brainstorming

* different surfaces for Croquet with CDs, jello, bubble wrap
 
* soccer battle royale but you use your hands, Gaga

* conductive floor, walls send out electrical signal

* ya slap the jello


# Kick The Can/Gaga Thing (tinfoil ball + jello)

* you have a wall you need to defend with your fingers, everyone puts two fingers in the little hexagon

* ”kick” a tinfoil ball back and forth with your fingers 

* Jello is conductive, we use Jello as the wall or floor


# Jello Slappy Game/Hungy Hungy Hippos/ Greedy Greedy Goats

* slap the jello to make your hippo eat the bottlecaps let out by servos


# Jello DJ (cd+ jello)

* slap jello to make CD spin clockwise, another jello to make it spin counterclockwise

* screw up a record and make a jello mess


but the final idea we decided on ended up using the yarn and jello from the list: 


# Jello Slap Tug-Of-War

* piezo sensor in jello

* every time ya slap it, the sensor causes your servo to actuate a little bit, string on each servo, whoever can pull the string in faster wins

# Potential Problems

* piezo in jello might not be 100% perfect in counting slaps

* jello falls apart/is messy

* slapped jello is kinda gross if you don’t wash your hands not gonna lie
